


this class provides an easy way to organize multi-threaded digesting
of sets of items.
 

The class itself does not know anything about the calculations do be performed,
it just provides 

It uses callbacks via a generic interface and the observer pattern 

This way, any set could be digested .




The generic interface provides methods on an action level.

The calling program must implement a class (preferably as an inner class of
your main class, which can access the data), which implements the methods of the interface.


Examples for utilizing this method are:

- digesting collections of documents

- image processing and analysis

- machine learning based on large collections of "agents"
