

A SomFluid is a module for a population of SOMs 

SomFluid contains to very different SOM-engines:
- the probabilistic SOM (pre-specific storage), and 
- the deterministic SOM (modeling/classification)

small, but important note:
SomFluid is not concerned with any administrative task, and it also does not
organize issues around the application of models (or their general life cycle), 
all of which is done by package NooLabSomOrganizer


Environmental Organization
---------------------------
Each Instance of SomFluid runs in its own directory, which is labeled by a random GUID;
This directory contains a small properties files which defines the 
individual/preferred ID. If such does not exist upon startup, it will be created
In the MetaNet context, this GUID will be associated with a unique Long value

SomFluid can produce offspring!
Producing such offspring also creates a small info file
Offsprings are connected through a Glue MessageBoard. 

Offsprings are created through thinning of networks and pullulation.
 
 
 
Internal Organization
--------------------- 

One instance of SomFluid contains exactly 1 instance,
albeit the topology can be 3-dimensional, and the network may have gaps


that can grow in either direction. 
Yet, "fibers" can detach, such producing another module.

The SomFluid uses the RepulsionField as its "physical" basis.
