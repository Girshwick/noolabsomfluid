This describes how to provide a variable description file

Assume that the home folder for all projects is <home>, and that
the project is named "prj", which thus resides in the folder 
<home>/prj

The data file will always be located in the relative path /data/raw,
which results in the sub-solder  <home>/prj/data/raw

Assume that the data file is named "tabdata1.txt", then the description file
should exist as

<home>/prj/data/description/tabdata1-variables.txt
 
The format of this file is simplified "ini-section",
that is, different semantic sections are opened by "[section name]";
the items = variables belonging to a particular section are simply
arranged as a list, one entry per row

It has to contain at least the section for the id variable and 
the section for the target variable.

Any listed section can be empty.

The list of sections that will be recognized comprises:

[ID]	the active ID variable
[IDS]	other ID variables, which are not used in any way
[TV]	the target variable
[TVS]	other potential target variables; they could be used as mutual TV in a automated series of investigations
[blacklist]	black-listed variables
[whitelist]	variables that are mandatorily included in any model
[absolute exclude]	variables that are absolutely excluded, no mechanism
	                exists to activate them
[treatment]	variables indicating a treatment; 
	        those variables might act as confounders, any inclusion must be checked carefully;
 	        yet, in some designs they need to be included as well
	        they will be checked in post-processing
[group]    	in experimental designs (forward as well as retrograde) these are important apriori organizational variables;
	        often expected to be formed by random assignment, they are not randomly built;
	        else, data could be split/filtered by those variables
                by default, they are excluded

The above sections are containing simple lists of variable labels
A special section requiring more details is defining the target group settings,
looking like the examples below. Note that the interval borders are
denoting pairs of [lo .. hi[ , i.e. the lower value is included
while the upper value is excluded, except the largest upper border. 
These intervals serve as a basis for a (dual or ordinal) recoding of the values 
and the identification of prototypes as "belonging" to the target group 
("desired" outcome) or not.

Example 1:
[TGS]
mode = single
group.1 = 0.13;0.56

at least 1 group is required; 
if "format" is not given, format=raw is assumed


Example 2:
[TGS]
mode = single
format = raw
group.1 = intermediate: 0.13;0.56
group.2 = high: 0.7;1.0
excludedvalues = 0.8;


Example 3:
[TGS]
mode = multi
format = relative
group.1 = A: 0;0.14
group.2 = B: 0.14;0.35
group.2 = B: 0.14;0.35
group.2 = B: 0.35;0.65
group.2 = B: 0.65;1.0
excludedvalues = 0.8;


***
             

if the section [TGS] is missing, but the target variable exists, then
it is assumed that mode=single. Additionally, the target group is interpreted
as a binary one, while the target group is dynamically assigned to the 
less frequently occurring group.
