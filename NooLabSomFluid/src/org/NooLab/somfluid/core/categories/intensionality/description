A proper distinction between the extensional part and the intensional part is established.
In the intensional part, profiles are distinguished from weights (in standard kohonen, they are not distinguished)
It is important to understand that what is commonly called "weight" vector is not a weight vector at all. 
Its the profile vector that describes the intensional mapping of the extensional list.
