/**
 * 
 * creates a 3-dim arrangement by single or z-formed folding
 * 
 * 
 * folding changes the physical distance between nodes
 * 
 * Actually, this class replaces the simple geometric neighborhood function
 * by a much more elaborated one.
 * 
 * It implements a particular actual network topology, far beyond the regular grid 
 * 
 * Particularly, geometry is not the only "element" of building the signal horizon.
 * Think of chemical blockers in an area, or about nodes that act more 
 * as routers and transmitters than as "associative population"
