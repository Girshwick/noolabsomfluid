 - grow by attachment and densification
 - differentiate by melting nodes away

Sheets grow by attachment first, then by densification, then they fold


Only if a field is a sheet, it can be folded. Fields do not fold.
In other words, going from fields to sheets means to 
proceed from logic to physis.

The sheet provides the necessary additional structures, interfaces,
classes and methods to enrich fields such that they behave as a sheet
