the growing SOM paradigm to allow for a movement the nodes (NOT the particles).

That is, the nodes (aka: information) may move on the substrate (aka:neurons). 

This movement is according to some property of the nodes, e.g. their similarity,
ther frequency of activation, their "size"/"weight" etc.


This movement allows for a local development of the SOM. It is NOT necessary
to consider always all the nodes in learning. If there are once multiple areas
describing similar issues, the nodes (aka: information packages) will move
closer together after a while

The movements of all nodes are mutually constrained through a 


-> energy minimization in a graph ... is NP complete, so any approximate
solution will do it  

practically, we use a spring system, which is confined to the location of the particles
a force directed graph, using toxiclibs
-> not in parallel mode...
