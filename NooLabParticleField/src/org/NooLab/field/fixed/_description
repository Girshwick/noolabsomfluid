coordinates are fixed as an "Integer" grid (grid on the ordinal level) 

Yet, the grid is NOT equal to the location of nodes, particularly it
offers a better resolution. 

        Such the Number of Particles <= number of grid nodes !
        
In other words, we still distinguish between substrate and particles!
(VERY important principle)

This means (1) that there is a parameter distance, of which it is
meaningful to calculate an average... this average can change in regions
and it can change over time

(2) a restricted type of growth is possible. If the number of particles
grows, the average density decreases, and the variance of the regional
average increases.

this can influence the dynamics of the grid considerably.

(3) a restricted form of movement is possible and can be switched off/on.
the movement is discontinuous and is more hopping than moving

Due to the fixed grid, the movement of the particles is much easier 
to administer and to control

Distance is calculated on the bases of the logical grid, NOT from the 
perspective of the particles, such, the number of abstract "locations"
that need to be checked to find neighbors is always geometrically 
limited;   
It is not necessary to loop through the particles, and the particles 
can be kept more simple.


The whole grid can grow by attachment / insertion
