coordinates are fixed as an "Integer" grid (grid on the ordinal level) 

Yet, the grid is NOT equal to the location of nodes, particularly it
offers a better resolution. 

        Such the Number of Particles <= number of grid nodes !
        
In other words, we still distinguish between substrate and particles!
(VERY important principle)

This means (1) that there is a parameter distance, of which it is
meaningful to calculate an average... this average can change in regions
and it can change over time

(2) a restricted type of growth is possible. If the number of particles
grows, the average density decreases, and the variance of the regional
average increases.

this can influence the dynamics of the grid considerably.

(3) a restricted form of movement is possible and can be switched off/on.
the movement is discontinuous and is more hopping than moving

Due to the fixed grid, the movement of the particles is much easier 
to administer and to control

Distance is calculated on the bases of the logical grid, NOT from the 
perspective of the particles, such, the number of abstract "locations"
that need to be checked to find neighbors is always geometrically 
limited;   
It is not necessary to loop through the particles, and the particles 
can be kept more simple.


The whole grid can grow by attachment / insertion

One advantage of a clear formulation of a planar substrate is that
we can regard it as a sheet. Sheets can be folded, and such the distance
between nodes can changes.

One could imagine, that a sheet is in a box, then, by growing, it must fold.
This triggers in turn a 2.n dimensional structure (as in the brain)

We also could build easily layers...


===========================

any part of a fixed field could be translated into a repulsion field, just for
rearranging the particles, then back-translating it again to the fixed (and more faster) form.
